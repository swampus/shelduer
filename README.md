# Shelduer

🛡️ Declarative runtime access control system for mutable and AI-generated Java code.

> What if `volatile` is no longer enough?

Shelduer provides annotation-based access governance that survives class reloading, self-modifying code, and AI-driven architecture evolution.

---

## ✨ Features

- `@AccessControlled` annotation for fields and methods
- Runtime ledger with allow/block logic
- External `ShelduerClient` for integration with AI systems
- Works without `volatile`, `synchronized`, or shared memory primitives
